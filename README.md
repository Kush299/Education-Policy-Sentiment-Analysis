# Education-Policy-Sentiment-Analysis
The Education Policy Sentiment Analysis project aims to assess public opinions on educational policies by analyzing large datasets of textual content. Using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the system classifies sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in articles, social media, and public statements. This project helps policymakers and stakeholders understand public sentiment trends, enabling more informed decisions in the education sector.
